# YouTube Live Subscriber Count
## Info
This app can be used for showing the live count of subscribers<br>
You can search strings like *pewdiepie* and you can also use the channel ID, e.g. *UC-lHJZR3Gqxm24_Vd_AJ5Yw*
I promise, that embed version will be in v0.3
## How To
When you'll write the search string, it'll use Google API to search for the matching channel.
## Embed
If you want to add the embed version in your stream, but you don't want to wait, you can use this URL:<br>
`https://creeperman007.github.io/projects/subscounter/embed/?uid=channellName&color=000000`<br>
You have to edit following parameters:
* `uid` is the search string (example: `uid=pewdiepie`)
* `color` is color of the text. You have to use *hex code* (example: `color=000000` - the text will be black)<br>
Example url: [https://creeperman007.github.io/projects/subscounter/embed/?uid=pewdiepie&color=000000](https://creeperman007.github.io/projects/subscounter/embed/?uid=pewdiepie&color=000000)<br>
