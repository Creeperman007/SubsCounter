# YouTube Live Subscriber Count
## Info
This app can be used for showing the live count of subscribers<br>
You can search strings like *pewdiepie* and you can also use the channel ID, e.g. *UC-lHJZR3Gqxm24_Vd_AJ5Yw*<br>
If you want to help me with developing this app, you can fork this repo. The main code is located @ `/source/resources/app/`<br>
Then just make new pull request.
## How To
When you'll write the search string, it'll use Google API to search for the matching channel.
## Embed
If you want to add the embed version in your stream, you can use following URL:<br>
`https://creeperman007.github.io/projects/subscounter/embed/?uid=channellName&color=000000`<br>
You have to edit following parameters:
* `uid` is the search string (example: `uid=pewdiepie`)
* `color` is color of the text. You have to use *hex code* (example: `color=000000` - the text will be black)<br>
