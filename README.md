#YouTube Live Subscriber Count
##Info
This app can be used for showing the live count of subscribers<br>
In this state, you can only use the YouTube channel ID but don't worry, I'm working on the *search* function.<br>
~~App also includes the *embed* version. It have transparent background, so you can use it in livestreaming in OBS etc.~~
##How To
As I said, it can accept only Channel ID. If you don't know, how to get it, don't worry. Until I'll publish the updated version, you can use [this app](https://johnnythetank.github.io/youtube-channel-name-converter/) to get the ID.
##Download
